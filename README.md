# cub3d
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game.

This project will enable us to explore ray-casting. the goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way. 
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable us to improve our skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
